# **1. OVERVIEW**

This exercise focus on using **Tableau Desktop** to create **multiple** **population pyramids** for Singapore based on data updated to June 2022.

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
Population Pyramid helps to visualise the distribution of age and gender for a given location.

The chart generally have three trends : [^1]

+-----------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| trend (shape)         | character                    | remarks                                                      |
+=======================+==============================+==============================================================+
| Expansive             | -   High fertility rate.     | -   larger percentage of young population.                   |
|                       |                              |                                                              |
| (triangle)            | -   High mortality rate.     | -   lower than average life expectancy.                      |
|                       |                              |                                                              |
|                       |                              | -   usually associate with developing nation.                |
+-----------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Constrictive          | -   Constant fertility rate. | -   High numbers of middle aged population.                  |
|                       |                              |                                                              |
| (wider in the mdidle) | -   Low mortality rate.      | -   Senior population may be larger than younger population. |
+-----------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| Stationary            | -   Low fertility rate.      | -   depict stable population.                                |

## **1.1 Instruction**

-   Reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at the **Planning Area** level by using the **Age-Sex** **Population Pyramid** method.

-   Display nine (9) Population Pyramids, each representing a planning area in a single view.

# **2. PLOT MULTIPLE POPULATION PYRAMID with TABLEAU DESKTOP**

There are four (4) main flows involved to plot multiple population pyramid.

-   acquire and upload data.

-   inspect and wrangle data.

-   plot multiple population pyramid.

-   organise plotted charts on dashboard.

## **2.1 Acquire & Upload Data**

### **2.1.1 Acquire Data**

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
This study will be based on demographic data set downloadable from [Singstat.gov.sg](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data).

-   Download "Singapore Residents by Planning Area Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022" in CSV format.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## [**Highlights of the data set**]{style="color:#3a9c88"}

1.  Data may not add up due to rounding.

2.  For June 2022, Planning Areas refer to areas demarcated in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 2019.

3.  Data from 2003 onwards exclude residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer as at the reference period.

4.  Metadata :

    -   PA = Planning Area

    -   SZ = Subzone

    -   AG = Age Group

    -   Sex = Sex

    -   TOD = Type of Dwelling

    -   Pop = Resident Count

# **4. DISCUSSION**

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
Out of 55 Singapore Planning Areas (PAs) in this study, nine are filtered based on the top 9 highest population count. Then, explore the distribution of age and sex for each PA with the population pyramid.

Only two PAs, namely Bedok and Jurong West, have a predominantly constrictive trend pattern. The rest of the 7 PAs show a mixture of constrictive trends with some form of either expansive or stationary trend.

On the other hand, Punggol area is the only PA showing a mixture of **constrictive trends** with the noticeable **expansive trend** observed below age 30. While the middle-aged group is the largest population, its younger generation population (below age 14) is higher than the age range 15 to 29. This developing township was re-vitalised by the **Punggol 21-plus** plan around the early 2010s that envisioned having 96,000 units when fully developed, attracting Gen-X and older generation, and their descendants contributed to the observed expansive trend, especially those below age 9.[^2]

Tampines, Sengkang and Yishun are the PAs with "pillar"-like distributions. Unlike Tampines and Yishun, which have a higher Gen Y population, Sengkang has a higher Gen X population.

6 out of 9 PAs, Bedok, Tampines, Woodlands, Hougang, Yishun and Chua Chu Kang, have a relatively large population of age groups above age 55. More resources and services will be needed to support senior welfare and probably set up more facilities or infrastructures.

However, there are a few downsides to the population pyramid. First, it's not easy to visually analyse or identify which PA has a wider gap by gender.
