# **1. OVERVIEW**

This exercise focus on using **Tableau Desktop** to create **multiple** **population pyramids** for Singapore based on data updated to June 2022.

Population pyramid

definition? what insights can be derived?

usage to analysts? decision makers?

## **1.1 Instruction**

-   Reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at the **Planning Area** level by using the **Age-Sex** **Population Pyramid** method.

-   Display nine (9) Population Pyramids, each representing a planning area in a single view.

# **2. PLOT MULTIPLE POPULATION PYRAMID with TABLEAU DESKTOP**

There are four (4) main flows involved to plot multiple population pyramid.

-   acquire and upload data.

-   inspect and wrangle data.

-   plot multiple population pyramid.

-   organise plotted charts on dashboard.

## **2.1 Acquire & Upload Data**

### **2.1.1 Acquire Data**

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
This study will be based on demographic data set downloadable from [Singstat.gov.sg](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data).

-   Download "Singapore Residents by Planning Area Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022" in CSV format.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## [**Highlights of the data set**]{style="color:#3a9c88"}

1.  Data may not add up due to rounding.

2.  For June 2022, Planning Areas refer to areas demarcated in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 2019.

3.  Data from 2003 onwards exclude residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer as at the reference period.

4.  Metadata :

    -   PA = Planning Area

    -   SZ = Subzone

    -   AG = Age Group

    -   Sex = Sex

    -   TOD = Type of Dwelling

    -   Pop = Resident Count

    -   Time - Time / Period

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## [**note : If the above screen is not your landed screen, click here**]{style="color:#3a9c88"}

Fret not! If **Figure 2.2** is your landed screen, from the bottom left corner, click "**Data Source**". You will be directed to the homepage, then perform **Step-1**.

:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
**Step-2** : Select "**respopagesextod2022**" when prompted by an "**Open**" window.
:::

:::

## **2.2 Wrangle Data**

### **2.2.1 Derive New Calculated Fields**

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
Step-3 - Click on the inverted triangle icon under the "**Sex**" field, as highlighted in **Figure 2.3**.

![Figure 2.4](images/image-1398127722.png){fig-alt="To open the input panel for the creation of calculated field." width="400"}

Step-4 - Select "**Create Calculated Field...**" from the drop-down options (refers to **Figure 2.4**) to open an input panel, as shown in **Figure 2.5**.

![Figure 2.5](images/image-726087864.png){fig-alt="User will be prompted with the input panel for the creation of calculated field." width="400"}

Step-5 - To create "**Male Population**" measured field, first change the field title to "**Male Population**". Next, input "**IF \[Sex\] ="Males" THEN \[Pop\] END**", as shown in **Figure 2.6**.

![Figure 2.6](images/image-1552505160.png){fig-alt="Input title and formula to derive a new calculated field i.e. \"Male Population\"." width="400"}

Step-6 - Repeat **Step-5** but with title as "**Female Population**", and replace "**Males**" with "**Females**".

### **2.2.2 Identify Top 9 Planning Area by Population**

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
Step-7 - Double click "**PA**" field to place it within the "**Rows**" panel, as shown in **Figure 2.7**.

Step-8 - Double click "**Pop**" field from the table on the left. It will be automatically summed up within the "**Rows**" panel.

![Figure 2.7](images/image-1919704893.png){fig-alt="Sum population for each planning area in Singapore." width="400"}

Step-9 - Change "**10**" to "**9**" for the "**Top**" value under the **"Top**" tab, as shown in **Figure 2.8**.

![Figure 2.8](images/image-690824896.png){width="400"}

Step-10 - Drag "**Sex**" to place at the "**Color**" under "**Marks**" pane, as shown in **Figure 2.9**.

![Figure 2.9](images/image-714966271.png){fig-alt="Filtered output that shows top 9 planning area with the highest Singapore population count." width="400"}

Step-11 - Select "**circle views**" from the "**Show Me**" pane.

![Figure 2.10](images/image-306868433.png){fig-alt="Edit y-axis to reduce empty space below the plot." width="400"}

Step-12 - Edit Axis :

-   Tick the "Fixed" range option.

<!-- -->

-   Increase the value for "Fixed start" to 90,000.

-   Reduce the value for "Fixed end" to 150,000.

![Figure 2.11](images/image-453180512.png){fig-alt="Show mark label, chart title." width="400"}

Step-13 - Show mark label, as shown in Figure 2.11.

Step-114 - Add chart title.

## 2.3 Plot Population Pyramid

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
Step 1 - Double click "AG" to place it within the "Rows" panel.

Step 2 - Drag the "Sex" field to "Color" under the "Marks" panel.

By now, the sheet should have been set up like the screenshot below.

![](images/image-694405821.png)

![](images/image-623100833.png)

Step 4 - Right click on the "Male Population" as shown above to select "Edit Axis...".

Step 5 - Tick the "Reversed" checkbox under the "Scale" section.
