# 1. OVERVIEW

This exercise focus on using **Tableau Desktop** to create a **population pyramid** for Singapore based on data up to June 2022.

# 2. PLOT POPULATION PYRAMID

## **2.1 Acquire Data**

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple" icon="false"}
This study will be based on demographic data set downloadable from [Singstat.gov.sg](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data).

## [**Highlights of the data set**]{style="color:#3a9c88"}

1.  Data may not add up due to rounding.

2.  For June 2022, Planning Areas refer to areas demarcated in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 2019.

3.  Data from 2003 onwards exclude residents who have been away from Singapore for a continuous period of 12 months or longer as at the reference period.

4.  Metadata :

    -   PA = Planning Area

    -   SZ = Subzone

    -   AG = Age Group

    -   Sex = Sex

    -   TOD = Type of Dwelling

    -   Pop = Resident Count

    -   Time - Time / Period
