# **1. OVERVIEW**

This study explores data visualisation using [***Tidyverse***](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package.

five methods for INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALISATION

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## [**Scope of this study :**]{style="color:#3a9c88"}

In this exercise, learn how to create :

-   ggstatsplot package to create visual graphics with rich statistical information,

-   performance package to visualise model diagnostics, and

-   parameters package to visualise model parameters
:::

# **2. R PACKAGE REQUIRED**

## **2.1 Load R Packages**

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse) 
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## [**Usage of R Packages :**]{style="color:#3a9c88"}

-   [**ggstatsplot**](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/) is an extension of [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.

    -   To provide alternative statistical inference methods by default.

    -   To follow best practices for statistical reporting. For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the [APA](https://my.ilstu.edu/~jhkahn/apastats.html) gold standard for statistical reporting. For example, here are results from a robust t-test.

# **3. DATA PREPARATION**

## **3.1 Acquire Data Source**

This study will be based on fictitious data set provided with this lesson.

## **3.2 Import Data**

### **3.2.1 Import Data**

Involved two (2) steps : import and inspect imported data set.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")

problems(exam_data)
```

# 4.

## 4.1 One-sample test: *gghistostats()* method

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(data = exam_data,
             x = ENGLISH,
             type = "bayes",
             test.value = 60,
             xlab = "English scores")
```

### Unpacking the Bayes Factor

-   A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

-   That's because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

-   When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as

-   The [**Schwarz criterion**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.

### How to interpret Bayes Factor

A **Bayes Factor** can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one---first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by [Lee and Wagenmakers](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.1999.10474443?needAccess=true) in 2013:

### Two-sample mean test: *ggbetweenstats()*

In the code chunk below, [*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(data = exam_data,
               x = GENDER, 
               y = MATHS,
               type = "np",
               messages = FALSE)
```

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

### Oneway ANOVA Test: *ggbetweenstats()* method

In the code chunk below, [*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.

```{r}
ggbetweenstats(data = exam_data,
               x = RACE, 
               y = ENGLISH,
               type = "p",
               mean.ci = TRUE, 
               pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
               pairwise.display = "s",
               p.adjust.method = "fdr",
               messages = FALSE)
```

-   "ns" → only non-significant

-   "s" → only significant

-   "all" → everything

### Significant Test of Correlation: *ggscatterstats()*

In the code chunk below, [*ggscatterstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggscatterstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.

```{r}
ggscatterstats(data = exam_data,
               x = MATHS,
               y = ENGLISH,
               marginal = FALSE)
```

### Significant Test of Association (Depedence) : *ggbarstats()* methods

In the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using [*cut()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cut).

```{r}
exam1 <- exam_data %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = cut(MATHS,
                          breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100)))
```

In this code chunk below [*ggbarstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbarstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association

```{r}
ggbarstats(exam1, 
           x = MATHS_bins, 
           y = GENDER)
```
